<h3 id="three-project-ideas">Three Project Ideas</h3>
<p>After some brainstorming sessions, we came up with three proposed ideas for our project.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="1-penpal-for-the-retired-or-elderly">1. PenPal for the retired or elderly</h4>

<p><strong>What is the problem/service?</strong><br />
During COVID-19 majority of the retirement homes and nursing homes were in extreme lock down. Locked down to the point where the seniors were restricted from being with their family. This led to seniors having extreme loneliness.</p>

<p><strong>Why it is important?</strong><br />
Extreme loneliness could lead one to having depression, anxiety disorders and suicide. The elders are quite important in our community and part of the Calgarian family. They have the right to have as much social interaction as we do if not more. Without the experience of our elders we wouldn‚Äôt be where we are now.</p>

<p><strong>How are you going to solve it?</strong><br />
The idea to solve this was to design an app that connects the elders to students, teenagers, young adults basically anyone who would like to seek advice or just hang out. We all know that the most experienced people in our community are these seniors, so suppose a student engineer, doctor or plumber wanted to talk to someone with more experience and learn how to grow in their fields can now have the chance to do so. The app would describe each elder‚Äôs past and anyone can book appointments to talk with them over the app, zoom or whichever they please. To solve the issue of seniors not being able to sign up could be solved by targeting specifically the nursery homes and senior homes where the system can be setup by a staff member there. This would allow wisdom and experience to be passed onto the youth along with keeping seniors busy. After all who doesn‚Äôt like to talk about themselves.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of system will it be?</strong><br />
The program would most likely be a mobile app just because of the convenience it provides. The build will be quite like what‚Äôs app or skype. The build will mainly focus on the senior homes, nursery homes, and retirement buildings where each senior would have their own account. A website could also be viable for this idea. Each person would have their own account and meetings.</p>

<h4 id="2-houseplant-catalogue-and-watering-reminders">2. Houseplant catalogue and watering reminders</h4>

<p><strong>What is the problem/service?</strong><br />
Houseplants are a popular way to add a bit of life to the home, but with so many varieties, it can be hard to keep track of the care and watering needed for each plant. It can be especially intimidating for beginners and self-proclaimed ‚ÄúBlack-thumbs‚Äù, who might want to have plants around but believe they will kill any plants they own. With the right plant and watering schedule though, anyone should be able to keep houseplants.</p>

<p><strong>Why it is important?</strong><br />
There a number of known physical and psychological health benefits to keeping plants, but they cost time and money to own. When a plant dies, not only is that time and money gone, but it‚Äôs disheartening to see a plant you‚Äôve been tending to fade to nothing.</p>

<p><strong>How are you going to solve it?</strong><br />
To minimize plant deaths, the proposed system would allow a user to catalogue the plants they own and set up watering reminders. These plants would be connected to care instructions and tips based on a database of plant types and send watering reminders based on the plant‚Äôs size and needs. Each time a user opens the notification to water their plant, they would be prompted with additional instructions, depending on their experience level. These prompts would also be used to determine if the plant might need more or less time between watering.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of system will it be?</strong><br />
The system would be implemented as a mobile application. This would allow for easy access to plant information whether the user might be around their house checking on their plants or at the store looking at new plants. This would also create the most opportunities for the user to see push notifications for the care of their plants.</p>

<h4 id="3-whats-where---an-appwebsite-that-helps-you-remember-where-you-put-your-things">3. What‚Äôs Where - An app/website that helps you remember where you put your things</h4>

<p><strong>What is the problem/service?</strong><br />
Everyone has put something away thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôll remember where this is when I need it‚Äù, however when the time comes, you just cannot remember where it is. With this app, you will no longer need to waste your time thinking of and looking through every possible spot you could have placed the object. All you would have to do is load up the app/website, find the entry for that object, and it will show you where you placed it.</p>

<p><strong>Why it is important?</strong><br />
Although a rather minor issue, it is a problem that everyone has dealt with, and probably will have to deal with again. This app/website could save people a decent amount of time considering the frequency that this event occurs at, and how it probably takes several minutes, minimum, for people to find the object. It is also really annoying to just want to get going with something, like studying, but you can‚Äôt remember where you put your calculator since the last time you used it was around 4 months ago (totally didn‚Äôt happen to me üôÅ).</p>

<p><strong>How are you going to solve it?</strong><br />
Provide an app/website that essentially is just a list with many entries and all the entries will be objects (lead, sunglasses, Nintendo DS, etc.). You can then tap on the entry for that object and it will bring you to a page that will show you the location of the object, optional description of the location, and an optional picture of the location.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of system will it be?</strong><br />
This service sounds like it would be best suited to be a mobile application, as it would be the most convenient for the user to be able to access their lists from their phones, and then they would be able to bring their phones with them to look for the object. However, a website could also provide the same functionalities and features, minus the being able to walk around with it in their hand to look.</p>
