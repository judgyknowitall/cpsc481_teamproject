<h3 id="three-project-ideas">Three Project Ideas</h3>
<p>After some brainstorming sessions, we came up with three proposed ideas for our project.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="1-pen-pal-for-the-retired-or-elderly">1. Pen Pal for the retired or elderly</h4>

<p><strong>What is the problem/service?</strong><br />
With COVID-19, retirement homes and nursing homes have been placed in extreme lock downs. Locked down to the point where the seniors were restricted from being with their family. As a result, many seniors have been suffering from extreme loneliness.</p>

<p><strong>Why it is important?</strong><br />
Loneliness can lead to depression, anxiety disorders and even suicide. Elders are important in our community and part of the Calgarian family - they should have access to as much social interaction as we do, if not more. Without the experience of our elders we wouldn’t be where we are now.</p>

<p><strong>How are you going to solve it?</strong><br />
The proposed design is an app that connects the elders to students, teenagers, and young adults - anyone who would like to seek advice or just hang out. The most experienced people in our community are these seniors, so the app would give a student engineer, doctor, or plumber a chance to talk to someone with more experience and learn how to grow in their fields. The app would describe each elder’s past and give options to book appointments to talk with them over the app, zoom, etc. Whether that be a one-on-one mentorship or just talking and having fun with several random seniors. The issue of seniors not being able to sign up could be solved by targeting specifically the nursery homes and senior homes where the system can be setup by a staff member there. This would allow wisdom and experience to be passed onto the youth along with keeping seniors busy. After all who doesn’t like to talk about themselves?</p>

<p><strong>What kind of system will it be?</strong><br />
The program would most likely be a mobile app just because of the convenience it provides. The build will be quite like What’s App or Skype. The build will mainly focus on the senior homes, nursery homes, and retirement buildings where each senior would have their own account. It could also be connected to a web portal. Each person would have their own account and meetings.</p>

<h4 id="2-houseplant-catalogue-and-watering-reminders">2. Houseplant catalogue and watering reminders</h4>

<p><strong>What is the problem/service?</strong><br />
Houseplants are a popular way to add a bit of life to the home, but with so many varieties, it can be hard to keep track of the care and watering needed for each plant. It can be especially intimidating for beginners and self-proclaimed “Black-thumbs”, who might want to have plants around but believe they will kill any plants they own. With the right plant and watering schedule though, anyone should be able to keep houseplants. While there are a multitude of plant care apps available in the app store, they require that the user knows exactly what their plant needs to set up a schedule. In contrast, the proposed service would automate scheduling and help build up a user’s knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Why it is important?</strong><br />
There are a number of known physical and psychological health benefits to keeping plants, but they cost time and money to own. When a plant dies, not only is that time and money gone, but it’s disheartening to see a plant you’ve been tending to fade to nothing.</p>

<p><strong>How are you going to solve it?</strong><br />
To minimize plant deaths, the proposed system would allow a user to catalogue the plants they own by taking a photo of the plant or selecting the plant by name. These plants would be connected to care instructions and tips based on a database of plant types and send watering reminders based on the plant’s size and needs. Each time a user opens the notification to water their plant, they would be prompted with additional instructions, depending on their experience level. These prompts would also be used to determine if the plant might need more or less time between watering.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of system will it be?</strong><br />
The system would be implemented as a mobile application. This would allow for easy access to plant information whether the user might be around their house checking on their plants or at the store looking at new plants. This would also create the most opportunities for the user to see push notifications for the care of their plants.</p>

<h4 id="3-whats-where---an-appwebsite-that-helps-you-remember-where-you-put-your-things">3. What’s Where - An app/website that helps you remember where you put your things</h4>

<p><strong>What is the problem/service?</strong><br />
Everyone has put something away thinking “I’ll remember where this is when I need it”, however when the time comes, you just cannot remember where it is. With this app, you will no longer need to waste your time thinking of and looking through every possible spot you could have placed the object. All you would have to do is load up the app/website, find the entry for that object, and it will show you where you placed it.</p>

<p><strong>Why it is important?</strong><br />
Although a rather minor issue, it is a problem that everyone has dealt with, and probably will have to deal with again. This app/website could save people a decent amount of time considering the frequency that this event occurs at, and how it probably takes several minutes, minimum, for people to find the object. It is also really annoying to just want to get going with something, like studying, but you can’t remember where you put your calculator since the last time you used it was around 4 months ago.</p>

<p><strong>How are you going to solve it?</strong><br />
Provide an app/website that essentially is just a list with many entries and all the entries will be objects (lead, sunglasses, Nintendo DS, etc.). You can then tap on the entry for that object and it will bring you to a page that will show you the location of the object, optional description of the location, and an optional picture of the location.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of system will it be?</strong><br />
This service sounds like it would be best suited to be a mobile application, as it would be the most convenient for the user to be able to access their lists from their phones, and then they would be able to bring their phones with them to look for the object. However, a website could also provide the same functionalities and features, minus the being able to walk around with it in their hand to look.</p>

<p><strong>Does this product already exist?</strong><br />
Many applications for creating checklists exist, however there is not app that is a specific as this proposal, so the application will be created from scratch. However, UI’s from other list apps may be used and improved upon.</p>
