<h3 id="project-description">Project Description</h3>
<p>Our project application, <strong>Pot Perfect</strong> aims to help users of the application take better care of plants and to help users find and identify new plants that they might wish to learn more about or even add to their collection.</p>

<p>Our application achieves the first goal of trying to assist in plant care through two main features. One of the features for assisting in plant care being customizable and guided reminders, which allows users to plan out a cycle for watering, maintenance, fertilizing, etc., that best fits their individual plants. The second feature for assisting in plant care is the plant journal which allows users to update the status of their plants over time, and therefore notice and log changes to their plants.</p>

<p>Pot Perfect’s second goal of helping users find and identify new plants is accomplished through two main features. The first feature is plant identification, which allows users to choose one of three methods to identify what a plant might be. The three methods being, scanning the plant with the camera, taking a plant-based survey, and lastly, looking up the plant directly through the search function in the plant catalogue. The plant catalogue also serves to accomplish the second feature, which is allowing users to learn more about plants that they are interested in. The catalogue accomplishes this through containing a database of plant species which gives users the ability to search for and then learn about plants by selecting them within the catalogue. These entries in the plant catalogue will hopefully contain everything a user might wish to learn about a given plant.</p>

  <li>Click the plus icon which will take you to the “Add New Plant” screen</li>
  <li>Select the “Camera” option</li>
  <li>Point the camera at the plant and take a photo</li>
  <li>The app will provide a few plants based off what it determines to be the best matches</li>
  <li>The user selects the correct plant, and it will be added to their plant list</li>
</ol>

<p>Users can add a newly obtained plant to their plant list by using the catalogue provided.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the menu button on the “Plant List” screen</li>
  <li>Click on the green book icon to open the catalogue</li>
  <li>Search for the plant species using the search feature in the catalogue</li>
  <li>Click the plus button corresponding to the correct plant, adding it to the plant list</li>
</ol>

<p>Users can set up reminders to attend to their plants.</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the “Plant List” tap on the entry for the plant you want to set up reminders for</li>
  <li>On the “My Plant Info” screen, tap on the “Set Reminders”</li>
  <li>Tap on the pencil icon corresponding to the:
    <ul>
      <li>Watering reminder to change the frequency of watering reminders</li>
      <li>Fertilizer reminder to change the frequency of fertilizing reminder</li>
      <li>Custom reminder to create a custom reminder with a name for the reminder as well as a date for when to be reminded.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="horizontal-tasks">Horizontal Tasks:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Users can view a list containing an entry for all the plants they currently own, which allows them to view more information about a specific plant, as well as the plant’s current health status.</li>
  <li>Additional information of currently owned plants can be viewed on the individual “My Plant Info” pages for each plant in “My Plant List”.</li>
  <li>Additional information of any plant in the database can be viewed on the individual “Plant Info” pages for all the plants.</li>
  <li>The catalogue can be searched in order to find the database entry for any plant in the catalogue.</li>
  <li>The journal for every plant the user owns can be updated with new updates in order to help keep track of a plant’s health.</li>
  <li>When adding a new plant to “My Plant List”, if users do not know what species their new plant belongs to, they can use the survey option to help identify their new plant and add it to their list.</li>
  <li>When adding a new plant to “My Plant List, the user can use the camera to take a photo of their new plant so that the application can help them identify the species of their new plant and add it to their plant list.</li>
  <li>Users can edit things about the reminders they have set up for their plants, such as the frequency of the reminders for watering and fertilizing a specific plant.</li>
  <li>Users can create custom reminders for any purpose, for any one of the plants in their plant list.</li>

<h3 id="heuristic-evaluation">Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
<p>After designing the first draft of our high-fidelity prototype, our team was divided into three Evaluators and two Reviewers. Evaluators were given the Figma prototype in presentation mode and were then asked to interact with it independently while pretending to only know the general intent of the app. Each evaluator then wrote a list of problems they found in the app. The reviewers read each evaluation and individually constructed a table of issues ranked based on their severity and noted possible solutions. Finally, our team came together to read the final reviews and worked on creating the final draft of the prototype by addressing the more major problems first before trying to fix the minor ones. Since some of the issues couldn’t be addressed in the prototype, we decided to exclude them from the final heuristic evaluation report. All evaluations, the individual Reviews, and the final evaluation report are available in the Appendix.</p>

<p>The issues were ranked 0 – 4 from negligible problems to usability catastrophes. Most rank 4 problems included major navigation problems such as being unable to escape certain pages or canceling tasks. Rank 3 Problems were major usability problems and they mostly included items that added confusion for the user such as insufficient or unintuitive icons. Some examples include wrong icons for depicting certain tasks or items that look like they can be tapped on but don’t have the functionality. Rank 2 issues are minor usability problems and include mostly items that could be clarified but are not overly important for the app to function, such as highlighting plants with overdue watering. Rank 1 problems include cosmetic problems and typos and finally rank 0 problems are negligible or cannot be fixed in the prototype. Some examples for rank 1 problems were unmatching colour palettes and difficulty to read certain text on top of similar coloured backgrounds. And some examples of the rank 0 problems were adding temporary information popups or adding extra information for all survey choices.</p>

<p>By conduction this evaluation, our team was able to test our app and pinpoint its flaws. This was a very important process for us to be able to put ourselves in the users’ stead to see which aspects could be unintuitive and cause confusion. After the evaluation, we made major design changes to the Plant Reminders page and many other minor changes in places such as the Plant List and the Plant Info pages. By going through these changes, we were able to unify the colour palette of the entire application and refine its design.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>This stage went quite smoothly. As in previous stages, this success was aided greatly by a preset schedule of internal deadlines and regular meeting times. Using the cloud-based tool Figma to create our prototypes also helped by allowing the group to work in the same file concurrently and see changes happening as they were discussed. Prior to formal testing, frequent run throughs of the prototype helped us to find and fix most logical issues in advance. After testing and reviewing of test results, it was also very helpful having one larger meeting to go through these results, fix the issues found, and add final touches together, all while making sure nothing new broke.</p>

<p>While many things went well, our unfamiliarity with Figma prior to the project caused some extra work. Because we were learning Figma’s functions, some time was lost to learning, as well as using some functions incorrectly or in a roundabout manner. If we were to do this again, we would spend some more time learning key features of the software prior to starting work on the prototype. We also ran into issues when a few pages’ goals were less well defined in the low-fi prototype. Doing this stage again, we would take some time to review the low-fi prototype as a group and add notes on any pages needing more details, to lighten the burden on the group member responsible for creating the initial hi-fi version of the page.</p>

<h5 id="dheerajs-evaluation">Dheeraj’s Evaluation</h5>
<ul>
  <li>On the plant list front page, it says that the water symbol with 9 days underneath it. It is a little bit confusing, does it mean 9 days left or water every 9 days?  </li>
  <li>When on the plant Dia page there is no back button. To go back to home page.  </li>
  <li>The trash button does not work on all the plants I am not sure if that is supposed to work? </li>
  <li>When pressing on Dia or Bach a picture of Vernoica or Dia pops up, (the previous plant) from my plant list I am not sure of understanding the purpose of that or if that is meant to be there. </li>
  <li>Beside each plant name there is the ability to change the name, should there be at least 1 implementation of that? </li>
  <li>When adding dieffenbachia to my plants, when we press the button it goes to veronica instead of Bach. The same thing occurs when adding Parodia, which should take you to the plant Dia.</li>
  <li>Maybe in health status the name should be changed to veronica instead of aloe vera. </li>
  <li>In sorting preference of settings maybe the one that is selected should be highlighted to make it clear of which one is picked currently. </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="gabbys-evaluation-doc">Gabby’s Evaluation Doc</h5>

<ul>
  <li>No good way to escape once you’ve started </li>
  <li>Don’t know button is a bit hard to see </li>
  <li>Consistency -&gt; should all the option buttons have an info button, even if they seem pretty straightforward? </li>
  <li>Other Matches – horizontal scrolling is broken in the prototype </li>
  <li>Should we just show top 3 next results? </li>
</ul>

<p><u>Plant Info</u> </p>
<ul>
  <li>White text is a bit hard to read in the plant care section </li>
  <li>No clear way to escape this page if you got here from the survey or catalogue and just want to go straight back to the plant list instead of adding   </li>
  <li>Got a little disoriented when scrolling down to the info didn’t fill the whole bottom of the screen. Seeing the little bit of the plant care felt a bit odd </li>
</ul>

<p><u>My Plant Info</u> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Delete button doesn’t do anything – could maybe show a confirmation dialog? </li>
  <li>Unclear what happens when the notification bell is on/off since there’s also Set Reminders below </li>
  <li>White icons are hard to see on this background</li>
  <li>If the plant bar could have a fixed position once it hits the top, that’d be super cool </li>
  <li>I felt like I should be able to tap this like a button </li>
</ul>

<p><u>Reminders</u> </p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of colours doesn’t quite feel like it fits with the rest of the app </li>
  <li>The dates don’t’ really feel important enough to all be highlighted in red </li>
  <li>The purple modal is inconsistent with other modals in the app </li>
  <li>Not super clear what the difference is between the add reminder button and edit </li>
  <li>Can’t cancel add/edit </li>

  <li>Back button is hard to see </li>
</ul>

<p><u>Journal</u> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Thought this whole thing was a button, was confused when I couldn’t click it all </li>
  <li>Add button uses a different icon than other pages in the app </li>
  <li>Colours get a bit overwhelming </li>
  <li>Can’t cancel status update </li>
  <li>Status updates area a little intimidating if you don’t really know what it means for your plant to be healthy – was expecting a few more details in the status update window 
    <ul>
      <li>Eg from sketches </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="jasons-evaluation-doc">Jason’s Evaluation Doc</h5>
<ul>
  <li>I felt as if there should have been an option for me to also add a plant via the catalogue, not just camera and survey
    <ul>
      <li>What if I already know that plant I have? </li>
      <li>I shouldn’t have to go through a redundant plant identification process </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Maybe the background should be darkened more when the menu button is pressed on the “Plant List” 
    <ul>
      <li>The “Add new plant” and button and to a lesser extent, the “catalogue” button are a little hard to see because of the background </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Should the settings design better match the rest of the design? 
    <ul>
      <li>Also, I feel like the text for version of the app is too big </li>
      <li>Shouldn’t the languages in the language change be in their respective languages? (like Francais, Espanol) </li>
      <li>Is the gear on the settings screen centered? </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I feel like the progress circle within the water droplet on the “My plant Info Page” makes it a bit too cluttered 
    <ul>
      <li>Number in the droplet enough? </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The text for set reminders and health status on “My plant Info Page” is hard to see before scrolling down 
    <ul>
      <li>I’m noticing that this may just be an issue that varies from screen to screen because on one monitor it is clear, but on another, it is a bit difficult to read </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dia plant info page has no back button in top left </li>
  <li>Went to camera to add plant -&gt; clicked best match for more info -&gt; went to plant info page -&gt; clicked back button -&gt; brought me back to My Plant List 
    <ul>
      <li>Should bring back to results of camera </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I think the whole “Update Status Button” in journal should be clickable, not just the icon</li>
  <li>No way to exit out of setting a reminder without submitting a new reminder </li>
  <li>No way to exit out of submitting a new journal entry without submitting a new journal entry </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="review-findings">Review Findings</h4>

<p>Through the testing done by Gabriella, Jason, and Dheeraj, the reviewers were able to find multiple severity 2, 3 and 4 problems. Many of the severe problems were found to be navigation related, such as the back function not returning the users to where it was supposed to, or certain navigations not registering in specific scenarios, and failing to consider different use cases. The reviewers determined less severe but common issues brought up in multiple testers evaluations. Some of these included a lack of a uniform theme for the application, typos, visibility issues and more. These persistent problems were placed a bigger focus for solving. Lastly, issues considered too superfluous and/or too costly to solve with too little of a return, were placed low in the severity rankings and either fixed with the least amount of priority or simply not fixed at all.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No escape from Survey once started 
    <ul>

  </li>
  <li>Cannot cancel status update 
    <ul>
      <li>Add close or cancel button </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(3) Major Usability Problems</strong> – Aspects that create confusion </p>
<ul>
  <li>On the Plant List page, the plant items contain a number of days for watering. It is confusing if it means 9 days left or water every 9 days? 
    <ul>
      <li>Add a progress bar symbol to indicate that the plant needs watering in 9 days </li>
      <li>Use explicit language -&gt; “9 days left” </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Edit Plant Name Function not implemented 
    <ul>
      <li>Implement one instance or display a pop up that indicates this feature is not yet implemented </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Trash Button does not seem to work 
    <ul>
      <li>Add a pop up to confirm deletion of plant from plant list  
        <ul>
          <li>indicate that it is not possible to remove plant in this prototype </li>
          <li>Or create instances of all combinations of the three plants in menu </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Catalogue, the “…” button is confusing. Expected that the entire pant item is clickable 
    <ul>
      <li>Remove button and make plant item clickable instead </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No clear difference between Add and Edit Reminder buttons  
    <ul>
      <li>Either remove edit button or add a smaller edit icon for every reminder </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Unclear how to set up auto-scheduled reminders or edit days between auto reminders 
    <ul>
      <li>Change design of the reminders page to distinguish between recurring reminders (automatically set at the beginning) and one-time reminders </li>
      <li>Or Simply only have Summer &amp; Winter watering schedules, fertilizing schedules, and custom reminders  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add and Edit Reminder Buttons too small to tap on 
    <ul>
      <li>Change design of this page </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Journal update Status looks like a button while only the icon is clickable 
    <ul>
      <li>Change colors and make text clickable too </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Status update area a bit intimidating if unsure how to discern plant health 
    <ul>
      <li>Add more details </li>
      <li>Change design according to sketches </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(2) Minor Usability Problems</strong> – Reinforce item meanings and add clarity </p>
<ul>
  <li>In Health Status, the species of the plant is displayed rather than its nickname 
    <ul>
      <li>Change the name in Health Status </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It is unclear which sorting preference is currently used in Settings 
    <ul>
      <li>Highlight the current selection </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Plants with overdue watering should stand out 
    <ul>
      <li>Highlight the edges or colour the background with red  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cannot search items 
    <ul>
      <li>Add minor prototyping capabilities 
        <ul>
          <li>Not found page </li>
          <li>And an autocompleted Aloe Vera page </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No clear way to escape Plant info page to directly go to main Menu 
    <ul>
      <li>Add close button on the top right corner </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Notification Bell on My Plant Info page is not very intuitive since there is also a Set Reminders Icon at the bottom 
    <ul>
      <li>Add a pop up when the notifications are turned off to remind user that they have turned off notifications and reminders will no longer notify their device </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Next Watering Section in My Plant Info seems clickable 
    <ul>
      <li>Add Navigation to Reminders page and add shadow for the button </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Expected to be able to add plants by name in the add plant menu 
    <ul>
      <li>Change “Add Plant Menu” to “Identify plant Menu” </li>
      <li>Change icon </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(1) Cosmetic Problems and Typos</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li>A little tricky to see plant/water images of Plant Items in Plant List 
    <ul>
      <li>Change Plant Item background colour </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Plant Names don’t stand out in Plant List 
    <ul>
      <li>Bold Names </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A little tricky to see the navigation buttons against the background in Plant List 
    <ul>
      <li>Whitewash the background instead of using grey </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Typo in Settings: “Comming Soon” 
    <ul>
      <li>Change to “Coming Soon” </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Camera Page looks very dark compared to the other parts 
    <ul>
      <li>Unify colour scheme with the other parts </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“Don’t Know” button on the Survey is hard to see 
    <ul>
      <li>Apply a more button-like look to pop it out from the background design </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>White Text is a bit hard to read on light green backgrounds 
    <ul>
      <li>Change either the background or the text colour for clarity </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Plant Info page got a little disoriented when scrolling down to the info section 
    <ul>
      <li>Lengthen the info section so that it fills the entire bottom section </li>
      <li>Enable scrolling for the Title section </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It would be cool to see the plant title bar fixed as well in My Plant Info 
    <ul>
      <li>Separate the frames and add Drag navigation to simulate scrolling </li>
      <li>Then, fix title bar </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reminders and Journal Page colours aren’t consistent with the rest of the app 
    <ul>
      <li>Change colour palette of this section </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Back button is hard to see in the Reminders page 
    <ul>
      <li>Change colour scheme of the page </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add button in Journal uses different icon 
    <ul>
      <li>Change icon? </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Colours in Journal can get overwhelming 
    <ul>
      <li>Change colour scheme </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Settings Design doesn’t match the rest of the app 
    <ul>
      <li>Change colour scheme and design </li>
      <li>Reduce text size to match the other sections </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Titles for Setting screens need to be centered 
    <ul>
      <li>Add a title and an image icon for every screen </li>
      <li>Make sure they’re aligned (either to the left or center) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The progress circle in the water droplet for My Plant Info makes it a bit cluttered 
    <ul>
      <li>Make the droplet half full depending on how much water the plant has and remove both the progress bar and the number since they are displayed in the bottom half of the page </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(0) Negligible Problems</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Catalogue -&gt; it is not clear that default items are recommendations 
    <ul>
      <li>Add a text at the top </li>
      <li>Ignore this issue since from the users’ standpoint, they do not necessarily need to know if these plants are recommendations. The catalogue is meant to be similar to a store’s website where they can simply browse items. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Survey Choices don’t all have info buttons. This breaks consistency 
    <ul>
      <li>Not all choices need more information  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Other Matches in Best Match Page do not have horizontal scrolling enabled 
    <ul>
      <li>Only showing the next top 3 matches should be fine. </li>
      <li>With a larger database, we could eventually add horizontal scrolling, but it is not needed for the current version. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Languages in settings should be displayed in their respective languages instead of English? 
    <ul>
      <li>Not necessarily. They could be changed depending on the language selected so it’s also clear which language is currently in use.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
