## Stage 4 Report

### Project Description
Our project application, **Pot Perfect** aims to help users of the application take better care of plants and to help users find and identify new plants that they might wish to learn more about or even add to their collection.  

Our application achieves the first goal of trying to assist in plant care through two main features. One of the features for assisting in plant care being customizable and guided reminders, which allows users to plan out a cycle for watering, maintenance, fertilizing, etc., that best fits their individual plants. The second feature for assisting in plant care is the plant journal which allows users to update the status of their plants over time, and therefore notice and log changes to their plants.  

Pot Perfect's second goal of helping users find and identify new plants is accomplished through two main features. The first feature is plant identification, which allows users to choose one of three methods to identify what a plant might be. The three methods being, scanning the plant with the camera, taking a plant-based survey, and lastly, looking up the plant directly through the search function in the plant catalogue. The plant catalogue also serves to accomplish the second feature, which is allowing users to learn more about plants that they are interested in. The catalogue accomplishes this through containing a database of plant species which gives users the ability to search for and then learn about plants by selecting them within the catalogue. These entries in the plant catalogue will hopefully contain everything a user might wish to learn about a given plant.

### User Tasks

#### Vertical Tasks:  
Users can add a newly obtained plant to their plant list by using the camera to identify the type of plant.  
1. Click the menu button on the “Plant List” screen  
1. Click the plus icon which will take you to the “Add New Plant” screen  
1. Select the “Camera” option 
1. Point the camera at the plant and take a photo 
1. The app will provide a few plants based off what it determines to be the best matches 
1. The user selects the correct plant, and it will be added to their plant list 

Users can add a newly obtained plant to their plant list by using the catalogue provided.  
1. Click the menu button on the “Plant List” screen 
1. Click on the green book icon to open the catalogue 
1. Search for the plant species using the search feature in the catalogue 
1. Click the plus button corresponding to the correct plant, adding it to the plant list 

Users can set up reminders to attend to their plants.  
1. From the “Plant List” tap on the entry for the plant you want to set up reminders for 
1. On the “My Plant Info” screen, tap on the “Set Reminders” 
1. Tap on the pencil icon corresponding to the: 
    - Watering reminder to change the frequency of watering reminders 
    - Fertilizer reminder to change the frequency of fertilizing reminder 
    - Custom reminder to create a custom reminder with a name for the reminder as well as a date for when to be reminded. 

#### Horizontal Tasks:   
1. Users can view a list containing an entry for all the plants they currently own, which allows them to view more information about a specific plant, as well as the plant’s current health status.  
1. Additional information of currently owned plants can be viewed on the individual “My Plant Info” pages for each plant in “My Plant List”.  
1. Additional information of any plant in the database can be viewed on the individual “Plant Info” pages for all the plants.  
1. The catalogue can be searched in order to find the database entry for any plant in the catalogue.  
1. The journal for every plant the user owns can be updated with new updates in order to help keep track of a plant’s health.  
1. When adding a new plant to “My Plant List”, if users do not know what species their new plant belongs to, they can use the survey option to help identify their new plant and add it to their list.  
1. When adding a new plant to “My Plant List, the user can use the camera to take a photo of their new plant so that the application can help them identify the species of their new plant and add it to their plant list.  
1. Users can edit things about the reminders they have set up for their plants, such as the frequency of the reminders for watering and fertilizing a specific plant.  
1. Users can create custom reminders for any purpose, for any one of the plants in their plant list.  
1. The plant journal will show users when they have missed a reminder for one of the reminders that have been set up for one of their plants.

### Heuristic Evaluation
After designing the first draft of our high-fidelity prototype, our team was divided into three Evaluators and two Reviewers. Evaluators were given the Figma prototype in presentation mode and were then asked to interact with it independently while pretending to only know the general intent of the app. Each evaluator then wrote a list of problems they found in the app. The reviewers read each evaluation and individually constructed a table of issues ranked based on their severity and noted possible solutions. Finally, our team came together to read the final reviews and worked on creating the final draft of the prototype by addressing the more major problems first before trying to fix the minor ones. Since some of the issues couldn’t be addressed in the prototype, we decided to exclude them from the final heuristic evaluation report. All evaluations, the individual Reviews, and the final evaluation report are available in the Appendix.  

The issues were ranked 0 – 4 from negligible problems to usability catastrophes. Most rank 4 problems included major navigation problems such as being unable to escape certain pages or canceling tasks. Rank 3 Problems were major usability problems and they mostly included items that added confusion for the user such as insufficient or unintuitive icons. Some examples include wrong icons for depicting certain tasks or items that look like they can be tapped on but don’t have the functionality. Rank 2 issues are minor usability problems and include mostly items that could be clarified but are not overly important for the app to function, such as highlighting plants with overdue watering. Rank 1 problems include cosmetic problems and typos and finally rank 0 problems are negligible or cannot be fixed in the prototype. Some examples for rank 1 problems were unmatching colour palettes and difficulty to read certain text on top of similar coloured backgrounds. And some examples of the rank 0 problems were adding temporary information popups or adding extra information for all survey choices.  

By conduction this evaluation, our team was able to test our app and pinpoint its flaws. This was a very important process for us to be able to put ourselves in the users’ stead to see which aspects could be unintuitive and cause confusion. After the evaluation, we made major design changes to the Plant Reminders page and many other minor changes in places such as the Plant List and the Plant Info pages. By going through these changes, we were able to unify the colour palette of the entire application and refine its design.

### Reflection
This stage went quite smoothly. As in previous stages, this success was aided greatly by a preset schedule of internal deadlines and regular meeting times. Using the cloud-based tool Figma to create our prototypes also helped by allowing the group to work in the same file concurrently and see changes happening as they were discussed. Prior to formal testing, frequent run throughs of the prototype helped us to find and fix most logical issues in advance. After testing and reviewing of test results, it was also very helpful having one larger meeting to go through these results, fix the issues found, and add final touches together, all while making sure nothing new broke.  

While many things went well, our unfamiliarity with Figma prior to the project caused some extra work. Because we were learning Figma’s functions, some time was lost to learning, as well as using some functions incorrectly or in a roundabout manner. If we were to do this again, we would spend some more time learning key features of the software prior to starting work on the prototype. We also ran into issues when a few pages’ goals were less well defined in the low-fi prototype. Doing this stage again, we would take some time to review the low-fi prototype as a group and add notes on any pages needing more details, to lighten the burden on the group member responsible for creating the initial hi-fi version of the page.
